## Registration Blurb

Settle is a consumer remittance UX for Nigerian families: one shared wallet, clear ₦ balances, Send money / Request / Settle up in everyday language. Built for Metropolis Track 02 (Consumer Products & Payments) on Monad — users never see chain jargon on the primary path. Demo: seed a Lagos family → fund → send → request → settle even.

> *Settle is a hackathon codename only. Final consumer brand TBD.*

2. ✅ Shared group wallet — create / invite 2–3 members + balances

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm run typecheck  # Run TypeScript type check
```

---

## Technical Notes

- **Client-side localStorage**: Groups, transactions, and requests persist in browser storage (same browser/device). No backend server in this MVP.
- **Hide-crypto UX**: All primary flows use Naira (₦) amounts. Crypto terminology only appears in footer disclaimers or demo mode labels.
- **Demo rate**: ≈ $1 = ₦1,580 (static mock rate for demo purposes)
- **Max 3 members**: Per MVP requirements, family wallets cap at 3 members.

---

## About (Demo Footnote)

> **Technical details for judges**: Settle runs on Monad testnet using USDC for transfers. Privy handles embedded wallet creation. All balances shown in Nigerian Naira (₦) are converted from USD stablecoin amounts at a demo rate. In a production version, real off-ramps would connect to local payment rails (bank transfers, mobile money).
